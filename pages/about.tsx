              On April 22, 2023, my world changed forever when my daughter Charlie was born. 
              As a software engineer, I wanted to create something special for her â€“ something 
              that would capture and preserve the beautiful moments of her life.

              This website is my gift to Charlie, built with love and code during my paternity leave, 
              in the quiet moments while she slept. It&apos;s a digital time capsule where I can share 
              her journey, her smiles, and all the little moments that make life magical.

              charliegram isn&apos;t just a photo gallery; it&apos;s a father&apos;s love letter to his 
              daughter, crafted one line of code at a time. It&apos;s my way of showing her that 
              even before she could understand what programming was, she was already inspiring 
              me to create.
